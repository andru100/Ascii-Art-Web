# Ascii-Art-Web
A simple website that takes user input, queries a Go based backend which then creates ascii art and sends it back to the frontend. Finally the site displays the ascii art and offers the option to download as multiple file types.

To start the server type 'go run .' /n
The server will start on port 4000 by default /n
The website can be visited at localhost:4000
